# About Me


## Introduction

Hello! I'm Damien Babin, a junior DevOps engineer with a background in the United States Marine Corps. My journey from military service to the tech industry has been driven by a passion for problem-solving and a desire to build scalable, efficient systems.

## Background

I served in the USMC as an Anti-Tank Missileman from 2020 to 2024, while holding many secondary billets, where I developed strong leadership skills, attention to detail, and the ability to perform under pressure. These experiences have shaped my approach to tackling complex technical challenges in the DevOps world.

## Professional Interests

My focus areas include:

- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Containerization and Orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD Pipelines
- Automation and Scripting

## Current Role

As a junior DevOps engineer, I'm constantly learning and applying new technologies to improve deployment processes, enhance system reliability, and optimize cloud resources.

## Personal Projects

1. **Personal Portfolio Website**: Built and deployed this site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages, implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions.


## Learning Journey

I'm committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in DevOps and cloud technologies. Currently, I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge of Kubernetes and exploring advanced Azure services.

## Hobbies and Interests

Outside of technology, I enjoy spending time with my family, staying active through various outdoor activities, and exploring new technologies in my free time.

## Connect With Me

I'm always open to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts, veterans transitioning to tech, or anyone interested in DevOps and cloud computing. Feel free to reach out through my [contact page](/contact/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/damien-babin-340b42260/).
