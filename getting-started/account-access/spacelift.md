## Spacelift Access

Spacelift is a powerful infrastructure as code (IaC) platform that provides a centralized and collaborative environment for managing and deploying Terraform code. To work with our codebase using Spacelift, you'll need a Spacelift account and access to our organization.

### Creating a Spacelift Account

1. Visit [https://app.spacelift.io/signup](https://app.spacelift.io/signup) and click on the "Sign up" button.
2. Follow the prompts to create a new account, providing your email address and a secure password.
3. Verify your email address by following the instructions in the verification email sent by Spacelift.

### Accessing Your Organization

Once you have a Spacelift account, you'll need to request access to your github organization.

### Working with Spacelift

Spacelift provides a user-friendly interface for managing Terraform configurations, running plans and applies, and collaborating with your team. Here are some key features and workflows:

- **Workspaces**: Workspaces represent separate instances of your Terraform configuration, allowing you to manage different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) independently.
- **Runs**: Runs are executions of Terraform commands (plan, apply, destroy) within a workspace. You can view the output, logs, and resources affected by each run.
- **Collaboration**: Spacelift supports collaboration features like pull requests, code reviews, and comments, making it easier to work as a team on infrastructure changes.

For more detailed information and guides, please refer to the [Spacelift Documentation](https://docs.spacelift.io/).
