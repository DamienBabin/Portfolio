## GitHub Access

GitHub is a popular code hosting and version control platform used for managing and collaborating on code repositories. To contribute to our codebase, you'll need a GitHub account and access to our repositories.

### Creating a GitHub Account

1. Visit [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) and click on the "Sign up" button.
2. Follow the prompts to create a new account, providing your email address and a secure password.
3. Verify your email address by following the instructions in the verification email sent by GitHub.

### Accessing Repositories

Once you have a GitHub account, you can access our public repositories by navigating to our organization's page (e.g., `https://github.com/Zigdon7`). If you need access to private repositories, you'll need to request access from the repository owners or administrators.

### Cloning Repositories

To work on our codebase locally, you'll need to clone the repositories to your machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

git clone https://github.com/Zigdon7/betterterraformpractices.git

### Contributing

Before making any changes to our codebase, please familiarize yourself with our contribution guidelines and code of conduct, which should be available in the repository's documentation or README file.
