# Infrastructure Documentation

Welcome to our infrastructure documentation. This section contains detailed information about our reusable modules and complete infrastructure projects.

## Structure

Our infrastructure code is organized into two main categories:

### [Modules](/modules/)
Reusable, self-contained units of infrastructure code that perform specific tasks. Our modules are:
- Version controlled
- Well-documented
- Tested and maintained
- Available for both AWS and Azure clouds

### [Projects](/projects/)
Complete infrastructure solutions that combine multiple modules to create full environments. Our projects:
- Follow infrastructure-as-code best practices
- Use our standard modules
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Support multiple environments

## Documentation Standards

All modules and projects follow our standardized documentation approach, ensuring:
- Clear usage instructions
- Complete variable definitions
- Architecture diagrams where applicable
- Deployment guides
