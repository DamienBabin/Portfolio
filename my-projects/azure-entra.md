# Terraform Cloud Azure Entra deployment

## Project Overview

This project involved migrating an organization's user management and server infrastructure from GoDaddy to Microsoft Azure, utilizing Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) for identity and access management. The migration was orchestrated using Terraform Cloud to ensure infrastructure as code best practices.

## Key Objectives

1. Migrate all user accounts from GoDaddy to Azure Entra ID
2. Transition server infrastructure from GoDaddy to Azure
3. Preserve existing data during the migration process
4. Set up user profiles and permissions in Azure Entra ID
5. Implement the entire process using Terraform for repeatable and version-controlled deployments
6. Optimize costs and achieve significant savings compared to the previous infrastructure

## Project Highlights

- **User Migration**: Successfully transferred all user accounts from GoDaddy to Azure Entra ID, ensuring continuity of access and minimal disruption to users.
- **Data Preservation**: Implemented strategies to maintain data integrity during the server migration, ensuring no loss of critical information.
- **Azure Entra ID Configuration**: Set up comprehensive user profiles and granular permissions within Azure Entra ID, tailoring access controls to organizational needs.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Utilized Terraform Cloud to define and manage the Azure infrastructure, including virtual machines, networking, and Azure Entra ID configurations.
- **Automation**: Developed Terraform modules and workflows to automate the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and potential for errors.
- **Cost Optimization**: Leveraged Azure's pricing models and resource optimization features to significantly reduce infrastructure costs compared to the previous GoDaddy setup.

## Outcomes

- Enhanced security posture through Azure's advanced identity and access management features
- Improved scalability and flexibility of the server infrastructure
- Streamlined user management processes
- Established a foundation for future cloud-based initiatives and integrations
- Achieved substantial cost savings, improving the organization's bottom line while enhancing capabilities

This project demonstrated proficiency in cloud migration strategies, identity management in Azure, cost optimization techniques, and the application of Infrastructure as Code principles using Terraform Cloud.
